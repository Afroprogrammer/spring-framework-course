# Source code for spring-framework-course

Hello Students,

All the code typed in the course lectures is in the **src** folder shown above. Please don't just download download/copy this code. I'd like you to be creating this project from scratch as I show you in the lectures step by step. You'll learn a bazillion times more effectively that way, I promise. This code is just for your reference in case you want to double-check the code you typed with what I typed in the video.
